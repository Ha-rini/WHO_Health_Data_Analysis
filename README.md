# WHO Health Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the "WHO Health Data" to identify trends and relationships between socio-economic, health, and environmental factors and their impact on life expectancy and health trends across various countries from 2000 to 2015.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Replaced missing values with the mean for numeric columns.
   - Addressed data quality issues like missing entries and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summarized the dataset and explored relationships between variables such as GDP, adult mortality, and life expectancy.
   - Visualized data using scatter plots, line graphs, and a correlation heatmap.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Plotted GDP trends over time for countries with the highest GDP.
   - Created plots to analyze life expectancy against factors like GDP and adult mortality.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conducted Z-tests to compare life expectancy between different countries and years.

## Technologies Used
- **R Programming**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `corrplot`, `GGally`.
